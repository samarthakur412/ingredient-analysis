2 kilograms mussels (cleaned, in their shells, just Google how to check they’re all fine to use so you don’t have a deadun that poisons you)
3 shallots (very finely chopped)
1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
2 glasses dry white wine (. Actually, make it 3 then you can drink one whilst cooking)
2 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
fresh parsley (Some chopped, for garnish, optional)
